#mytunes
This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor. This project was worked on with a pair. Mytunes is a simple online music player created using HTML5, Backbone.js, Underscore.js and jQuery. It currently only has 5 songs available in the library, which is populated with a seed file.

#Dependencies
    "jquery": "~2.0.3",
    "underscore": "~1.5.2",
    "backbone": "~1.0.0"

#Installation
Simply cd into the local directory on your machine and run this command if you have bower installed:

`$ bower install`

If you don't have bower, run this command first:

`$ npm bower -g install`

#Usage
After installing all the required dependencies, just open up the index.html file in Google Chrome and listen to some music!
